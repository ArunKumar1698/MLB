Predicting stadium attendance for major league baseball

Identified factors driving stadium attendance and developed dynamic prediction model using ensemble and sequential modeling to forecast attendance with 28% lesser MAPE than baseline.
SARIMAX model was used to address the causality between attendance and important features (game, player, geography and economy level indicators)
For the prediction task, various models were tried including tree based and sequuential models.
Two types of predictions were required - static to predict attendance of games ahead of the season start and dynamic to predict attendance while the season is underway
Bayesian optimization technique was used to optimize game schedule for MLB 2023
